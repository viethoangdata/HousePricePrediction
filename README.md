# Project Name
> Outline a brief description of your project.
This project aims to build a regression model using regularization to predict the actual value of prospective properties in the Australian housing market. The model will be used by a US-based housing company, Surprise Housing, to determine which properties to invest in.

* [General Info](#general-information)

Background:
Surprise Housing is a US-based housing company that uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them at a higher price. The company is looking to enter the Australian housing market and has collected a dataset of house sales in Australia to build a regression model that can predict the actual value of prospective properties.

Business Problem:
The business problem that this project aims to solve is to help Surprise Housing understand the pricing dynamics of the Australian housing market and determine which properties to invest in. By building a regression model, the company can identify which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house and how well those variables describe the price of a house.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is a 'trans.CSV' file containing information about house sales in Australia. The dataset includes information such as the location of the property, the number of rooms, the type of property, the distance to the nearest train station, and the price of the property.
